        <p>
            Technology has always been my gateway to a world of endless possibilities. I've been captivated by how components of various sizes come together to create powerful machines that shape our daily lives. My passion for technology began earlyâ€”I built my first computer as a sophomore in high school. By my freshman year of college, I turned this passion into action by starting my own phone repair and custom PC building business.

            As a first-generation college graduate with a degree in Information Technology, I have honed my skills through both academic and professional experiences. While at Kean University, I worked as an IT Help Desk Technician, assisting faculty with technical needs ranging from hardware repairs to software troubleshooting.
            
            Currently, I serve as a Manufacturing Quality Engineering (MQE) Technician at ZT Systems, where I ensure the quality of server production by collaborating with vendors, resolving critical issues, and driving process improvements.
            Through these experiences, I have developed a unique blend of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a passion for innovation. I am eager to continue exploring how technology can drive positive change while growing professionally and contributing meaningfully to the IT and manufacturing industries.
